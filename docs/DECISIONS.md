# DECISIONS.md — Architecture/Methodology Decision Record (ADR) Log

Every open methodological decision gets an entry: status (OPEN / CLOSED),
options, evidence required to close it, and — when closed — the Chapter 3
justification. Closing an item without recording the justification is
prohibited (PROJECT.md §34).

Entry template:

```text

## ADR-001 — Source partition for normalization/threshold statistics

Status:            OPEN
Question:          Are residual-normalization and threshold statistics fitted
                   on the healthy TRAINING block (v1.0 default) or the healthy
                   VALIDATION block (panel-reviewer recommendation, avoiding
                   in-sample optimism from training residuals being biased
                   small)? (PROJECT.md §22; MIGRATION_LOG.md G1; risk R6.)
Options:           training | validation
Evidence to close: Comparison of in-control false-alarm behaviour under both
                   settings on real healthy Kelmarsh data; Chapter 3 argument.
Decision:          —
Justification:     —
Affected modules:  M-19b (normalizers), M-20 (EWMA limits), M-03 (config enum
                   `threshold_stats_source`, default `training` pending closure)

## ADR-002 — Literature-anchored baseline NBM choice

Status:            OPEN
Question:          Which literature-anchored baseline NBM accompanies Random
                   Forest as an RQ1 comparator? (PROJECT.md §18; M-17
                   acceptance 2 requires the rationale and citation recorded
                   here before M-17 is DONE.)
Options:           To be enumerated from the SCADA-NBM literature review
                   (e.g., an ANN-style NBM consistent with established
                   literature). Deep learning is prohibited (PROJECT.md §39
                   reference in §5) — the baseline must respect that bound.
Evidence to close: Thesis literature review; supervisor confirmation.
Decision:          —
Justification:     —
Affected modules:  M-17

## ADR-003 — LightGBM as an optional later comparator

Status:            OPEN
Question:          Is a LightGBM comparator added alongside the mandated
                   baselines? Permitted only with ADR justification
                   (PROJECT.md §5). Default position: NOT added.
Options:           add | omit (default)
Evidence to close: A demonstrated RQ1 need the existing baselines cannot meet.
Decision:          —
Justification:     —
Affected modules:  M-17 (if added)

## ADR-004 — Canonical schema version log

Status:            OPEN (standing log)
Question:          Standing record of `schema_version` bumps (semver) required
                   by PROJECT.md §8. Each schema change appends an entry here
                   with its rationale.
Current version:   1.0.0 (initial; stamped by M-06 `app/data/schema.py`)
Affected modules:  M-06, M-07, M-29

## ADR-005 — FMEA rule sign-off log

Status:            OPEN (standing log)
Question:          Standing record of FMEA rule validations (Guard 7). A rule's
                   `validated` flag flips to true only through an entry here
                   citing the specific literature source (PROJECT.md §26).
                   Never invent references.
Entries:           none yet
Affected modules:  M-25, M-26

## ADR-006 — Chapter 1 Objective 2 conflict (MAPE + SHAP)

Status:            CLOSED (2026-08-11)
Question:          Chapter 1 as drafted (Objective 2) names MAPE among the NBM
                   accuracy metrics and SHAP-based explainability for physical
                   credibility. Both conflict with PROJECT.md v2.0 (§19 metric
                   set; LOCKED-07 SHAP prohibition).
Options:           follow Chapter 1 as drafted | follow LOCKED-01…10
Decision:          PROJECT.md v2.0 LOCKED-01…10 is authoritative (author
                   ruling, 2026-08-11). Chapter 1 predates the panel review;
                   its Objective 2 wording will be corrected by the author
                   separately. All code and specs build against the locks:
                   - Metrics: RMSE, MAE, R², bias. NO MAPE anywhere (M-18
                     acceptance criteria stand: MetricSet exposes exactly
                     these four fields).
                   - NO SHAP, no XAI, no attribution module, no shap
                     dependency. Physical credibility comes from causal
                     predictor separation (M-14) and condition-sliced error
                     diagnostics (M-18).
                   - RQ1 model is multi-target XGBoost (M-16).
                   - RQ2 comparisons route through matched-FPR only (M-23).
Justification:     Celsius is an interval scale, so MAPE has no meaningful
                   zero; SHAP explains the prediction, not the residual, and
                   the residual is the diagnostic signal. Chapter 2's own
                   review supports the SHAP exclusion: attribution identifies
                   influential inputs, not physical mechanisms.
Affected modules:  M-14, M-16, M-18, M-23
Process note:      Thesis chapters are never edited, rewritten, or patched
                   from this repository. Chapter/spec conflicts are logged
                   here and reported — never silently resolved (PROJECT.md
                   preamble; LOCKED-09 register discipline applies to all
                   user-facing text).
Source text read:  "Chapter 1 Introduction.docx" (SHA-256 prefix c01b9cc5d268,
                   2026-07-27) — identical copies in Thesis\Code and
                   Thesis\AI project files\Chapter 1 papers.

## ADR-007 — Canonical thesis source files

Status:            CLOSED (2026-08-11)
Question:          Multiple copies/variants of Chapters 1 and 2 existed with
                   misleading names ("updated", "FINAL_integrated"). Which
                   files are the canonical thesis text for all software and
                   requirements work?
Decision:          Author confirmation (2026-08-11). Canonical files:
                   - Chapter 1: "Chapter 1 Introduction.docx" (2026-07-27)
                     SHA-256 c01b9cc5d268684100095f069ad97953
                             f0ad57b511a2a3fd9840ab029a846da4
                   - Chapter 2: "Chapter_2_draft.docx" (2026-07-29 20:47)
                     SHA-256 6510fa47df560b3870f141deb1935a01
                             eabb5f5f695afa7819fc7fb991e4ddfb
                   "Chapter1_updated_sections.docx" and
                   "Chapter_2_FINAL_integrated.docx" are OLDER variants being
                   archived by the author — do not read them again.
Justification:     Hash comparison showed the Thesis\Code and AI-project-file
                   copies of each canonical file are byte-identical; the
                   misleadingly named variants predate them.
Affected:          docs/THESIS_REQUIREMENTS.md source references; any future
                   chapter reading. Chapter 3 does not exist yet; its
                   decision content is tracked in
                   docs/CHAPTER3_DECISION_QUEUE.md.
